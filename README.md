Module 6 Challenge Background                                                       

•	Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

•	Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Analysis                                                                                     

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

-	Included in WeatherPy is a relationship analysis comparison and linear regression model of the following:
-	
-	- Latitude vs Temperature
- Latitude vs Humidity
- Latitude vs Cloudiness
- Latitude vs Wind Speed 

-	Included in VacationPy is a map of the DataFrame generated in WeatherPy. Also included is map of hotels generated using an API call to Geoapify based on a DataFrame of Ideal Weather Conditions using the following conditions :

- Minimum temperature is 20ºC
- Maximum temperature is 30ºC
- Humidity is less than 50%

Note: The original activity asks to use hyplot to solve VacationPy, however there is a current version module conflict which was identified by one of the TAs and could not be solved by AskBCS. Plotly.express was used as a substitute.
